# # Mask R-CNN - Train on Shapes Dataset
# 
# 
# This notebook shows how to train Mask R-CNN on your own dataset. To keep things simple we use a synthetic dataset of shapes (squares, triangles, and circles) which enables fast training. You'd still need a GPU, though, because the network backbone is a Resnet101, which would be too slow to train on a CPU. On a GPU, you can start to get okay-ish results in a few minutes, and good results in less than an hour.
# 
# The code of the *Shapes* dataset is included below. It generates images on the fly, so it doesn't require downloading any data. And it can generate images of any size, so we pick a small image size to train faster.

# ## Training
# 
# Train in two stages:
# 1. Only the heads. Here we're freezing all the backbone layers and training only the randomly initialized layers (i.e. the ones that we didn't use pre-trained weights from MS COCO). To train only the head layers, pass `layers='heads'` to the `train()` function.
# 
# 2. Fine-tune all layers. For this simple example it's not necessary, but we're including it to show the process. Simply pass `layers="all` to train all layers.

# Train the head branches
# Passing layers="heads" freezes all layers except the head
# layers. You can also pass a regular expression to select
# which layers to train by name pattern.
model.train(dataset_train, dataset_val, 
            learning_rate=config.LEARNING_RATE, 
            epochs=5, 
            layers='heads')


# Fine tune all layers
# Passing layers="all" trains all layers. You can also 
# pass a regular expression to select which layers to
# train by name pattern.
#model.train(dataset_train, dataset_val, 
#            learning_rate=config.LEARNING_RATE / 10,
#            epochs=2, 
#            layers="all")

# Save weights
# Typically not needed because callbacks save after every epoch
# Uncomment to save manually
# model_path = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, "mask_rcnn_shapes.h5")
# model.keras_model.save_weights(model_path)
